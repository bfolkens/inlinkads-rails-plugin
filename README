InLinkAds
=================

= Usage

How to use the InLinkAds plugin in your Rails app.

== Install

Grab the plugin from GitHub and copy into your plugin directory:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/bfolkens/inlinkads-rails-plugin.git

== Update View

The InLinkAds plugin gives you helpers for injecting the InLink Ads into your content:

  <%= inject_inlink_ads(post_id, str) %>
  <label for="post_title">Title</label>

Where +post_id+ is a unique identifier to the page or post and +str+ is the content you wish to inject the InLink Ads into.

== Update Controller

Place the +inlink_ads_data+ method in the action that handles the view you wish to inject the ads into.  For example, in a controller +Page+ that handles showing the page with the action +show+, you might see something like the following:

  class PageController < ApplicationController
    def show
      @page = Page.find(params[:id])
      inlink_ads_data
    end
  end
  
The inlink_ads_data method creates an instance variable called +@links+ that contains the information for populating the links on the page.  The helper uses the data in this variable to inject the links into the content.
  
Somewhere in your +Page+ controller or your +Application+ controller, place the following:

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    private

    def read_post(id)
      Page.find :first, :conditions => ['id = ?', id]
    end

    def read_posts(last, limit)
      Page.find :all, :conditions => ['id > ?', last], :order => 'id asc', :limit => limit
    end

    def post_url(post)
      page_url(:id => post.id) + '.html'
    end

    def max_post_id
      Page.calculate :max, :id
    end
  end
  
The InLinkAds service will make a GET request of your site and pull the posts described by the methods above.  If your posts (or pages) are st
ored in a different model than "Post" then change the above to match your setup.  The important methods to define are:

  * +read_post+ - Returns one post that matches +id+
  * +read_posts+ - Returns posts starting with +last+ and returning a total of no more than +limit+
  * +post_url+ - Returns the URL to the page for +post+
  * +max_post_id+ - Returns the last id of posts
  
== Install the configuration

Create a new file in your config/initializers directory called inlink_ads.rb, containing the following:

  unless defined?(InLinkAds::CONFIG)
    InLinkAds::CONFIG = { :url => 'http://www.url.for.app.com/', :key => 'YOUR_KEY_FROM_TEXTLINKADS' }
  end
  
Replace the +url+ and +key+ with those appropriate for your site.

== Install the pages into the TextLinkAds service

Run the following rake task to send a request to the TextLinkAds site to install your InLinks:

  rake inlinks:install
